# TELOS - Nick's Life Operating System

## Overview

Nick is a father of two young children (5 years and 21 months), living in Frankfurt, Germany. He works as a division leader at a fintech startup where he's been since near the beginning and holds equity. He recently purchased an apartment with his family and is focused on building stability while managing the tension between career demands, family time, and personal growth.

## Life Stage

**The Squeeze** - The period where career is demanding maximum output, children need maximum presence, and financial obligations are at their peak. Time is the scarcest resource. This is temporary but intense.

## Core Identity

- **Father first** - Two young children who need presence, stability, and a role model
- **Builder** - Helped build a company from early stage, owns a division
- **Learner** - Deeply curious across many domains but time-constrained
- **Creative** - Runs weekly TTRPG sessions, interested in writing

## Current Reality

- **Location**: Frankfurt, Germany
- **Career**: SaaS Division Leader at fintech startup (founding team, equity holder)
- **Family**: Partner + two children (5yo, 21mo)
- **Housing**: Recently purchased apartment
- **Financial**: Stable income but low savings post-purchase; budget-conscious

## The Tension

The three pillars of the mission (Family, Growth, Self) are currently competing for the same limited resource: time. The challenge is not choosing between them but finding integration points and efficiency gains.
