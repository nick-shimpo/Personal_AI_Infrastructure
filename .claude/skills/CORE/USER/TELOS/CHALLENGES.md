# Challenges

## The Core Challenge: Time Scarcity

Everything flows from this. With two young children (5yo, 21mo), a demanding leadership role, and a new apartment, there is effectively zero slack in the system.

### Time Demands
| Area | Demand Level | Flexibility |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| Work | High (division ownership) | Low |
| Children | High (young ages) | None |
| Partner | Medium-High | Some |
| Apartment/Home | Medium | Some |
| Exercise | Currently zero | Needs solving |
| Learning | Currently zero | Needs solving |
| TTRPG | Weekly commitment | Protected |

## Financial Anxiety

**Situation:**
- Not poor - stable income, good job
- Recently purchased apartment (major financial commitment)
- Savings depleted by purchase
- Economic/geopolitical uncertainty creates anxiety about future

**Current Approach:**
- Living modestly
- Strict budget attention
- Working on compensation increase with employer

**The psychological weight:** Even when finances are objectively manageable, low savings + uncertain world creates persistent low-grade anxiety.

## Fitness Regression

**What happened:**
- Second child arrived
- Work responsibilities increased
- Apartment purchase added demands
- Exercise time disappeared

**Impact:**
- Unhappy with general fitness
- Likely affecting energy and mental clarity
- Creates guilt/frustration

**The trap:** Less exercise → less energy → harder to find motivation to exercise

## Learning Starvation

**Interests that are going unfed:**
- World news & geopolitics
- Social economics
- AI developments
- TTRPG craft improvement
- Writing (non-fiction and fiction)

**The frustration:** Deep curiosity + zero time to satisfy it

## The Compound Effect

These challenges compound each other:
- Financial anxiety → work harder → less time
- Less exercise → less energy → less capacity
- Less learning → feel stagnant → more anxiety
- Time scarcity → guilt about all three pillars
